# What is this repository?
- This is a survival anylysis project including data, code and full report.
- The target of this project is to study the factors afftecting the period of breastfeeding. A survival model is built on the duration of breastfeeding.
- This project is completed by Xingyu(Jason).

# Introduction 
Recent research has shown some evidence on the advantage on building the gut flora via breast-feeding for newborns. Breast-feeding initiation rates have increased in the USA; however, maintenance of breast-feeding for the recommended duration (six months) is low. It is desirable to model the the duration for better understanding the factors affecting the period and making corresponding solution to enlength this period. In this study, we will build a survival model on the duration of breastfeeding. 


# Data
The Infant Feeding Practices Study II (IFPS II), conducted by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) from 2005 to 2007, was a longitudinal study that followed mother-infant pairs from the third trimester of pregnancy throughout the first year of life to study a variety of infant feeding practices. The data set that we will analyze is a subset of the IFPS II data consisting of first-time mothers who breastfed their children. Several types of variables, which may be predictive of breastfeeding duration, are provided: demographics, income/work, prenatal attitudes towards breastfeeding, and neonatal breastfeeding experiences (within the first two weeks of life). There are 762 subjects and 40 variables recorded.
- The cleaned data is stored in file "breastfeeding.txt".
